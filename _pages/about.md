Welcome to my personal website!

I am Professor of Economic Policy at the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en), Head of the [Prometeia Think Tank](https://www.prometeia.it/en), and since 2025 Vice President of the Senior Board of the [Conselho das Finanças Públicas (CFP)](https://www.cfp.pt/), Portugal’s independent fiscal council.

Previously, I worked at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. (2010–2016) and at the Bank of Italy in Rome. I have collaborated with the OECD and the World Bank and served on the advisory committee of Confindustria, the Italian employers’ association.

I hold a Master’s degree in Political Economy (1999) and a Ph.D. in Economics (2001) from Boston University and was a visiting scholar at Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research (2005–06).

I am the author of *[The Magic Money Tree and Other Economic Tales](https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Money-Other-Economic-Tales/dp/1788213653)* (2021), and *[Preventing the Greenlash - How to Overcome Opposition to Green Policies](https://www.amazon.com/Preventing-Greenlash-Overcome-Opposition-Policies-ebook/dp/B0CW1DMDLJ)* (2024).
