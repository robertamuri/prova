# Lorenzo Forni

I am Professor of Economic Policy at the <a href=https://www.unipd.it/en target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Padua</a>, Head of the <a href=https://www.prometeia.it/en target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prometeia Think Tank</a>, and since 2025 Vice President of the Senior Board of the <a href=https://www.cfp.pt/ target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conselho das Finanças Públicas (CFP)</a>, Portugal’s independent fiscal council.

Previously, I worked at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. (2010–2016) and at the Bank of Italy in Rome. I have collaborated with the OECD and the World Bank and served on the advisory committee of Confindustria, the Italian employers’ association.

I hold a Master’s degree in Political Economy (1999) and a Ph.D. in Economics (2001) from Boston University and was a visiting scholar at Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research (2005–06).

I am the author of *<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Money-Other-Economic-Tales/dp/1788213653 target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Magic Money Tree and Other Economic Tales</a>* (2021), selected by the *Financial Times* among the year’s best economics books, and *<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Preventing-Greenlash-Overcome-Opposition-Policies-ebook/dp/B0CW1DMDLJ target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preventing the Greenlash: How to Overcome Opposition to Green Policies</a>* (2024).
